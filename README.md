This compiler is generated by ANTLR. So you need to add ANTLR to you CLASSPATH.

You could get information about ANTLR at www.antlr.org

OR Just:
    $cd /usr/local/lib
    
    $curl -O http://www.antlr4.org/download/antlr-4.0-complete.jar
    Or
    $wget http://www.antlr4.org/download/antlr-4.0-complete.jar

    $export CLASSPATH=".:/usr/local/lib/antlr-4.0-complete.jar:$CLASSPATH"


Obviously, you should install JDK first.
